/**
 * Function Expression: Functions can also be created using function expressions, where a function is assigned to a variable.
 * Function expressions can be named or anonymous. Anonymous function expressions are often used as callback functions or
 * immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE).
 * Example:
 */
let greet = function(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
};
